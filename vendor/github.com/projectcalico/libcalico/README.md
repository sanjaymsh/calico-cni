# libcalico

Libcalico is a library for interacting with the Calico data model. It also contains code for working with veths.
* It's written in Python (though ports into other languages would be welcomed as PRs)
* It currently just talks to etcd as the backend datastore.


It's currently focused on the the container side of Calico, though again PRs are welcomed to make it more general.
